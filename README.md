The __Solr Operator__ manages Apache Solr Clouds within Kubernetes. It is built on top of the [Kube Builder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) framework.

The project is currently in beta (`v1beta1`), and while we do not anticipate changing the API in backwards-incompatible ways there is no such guarantee yet.

If you run into issues using the Solr Operator, please:
- Reference the [version compatibility and upgrade/deprecation notes](#version-compatibility--upgrade-notes) provided below
- Create a Github Issue in this repo, describing your problem with as much detail as possible
- Reach out on our Slack channel!

Join us on the [#solr-operator](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/solr-operator) channel in the official Kubernetes slack workspace.

# Getting Started

Install the Zookeeper & Etcd Operators, which this operator depends on by default.
Each is optional, as described in the [Zookeeper](#zookeeper-reference) section.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f example/dependencies
```

Install the Solr CRDs & Operator

```bash
$ make install deploy
```

You can also deploy the Solr Operator by using our provided [Helm Chart](helm/solr-operator/README.md).

                        
## Running a Solr Cloud

### Creating

Make sure that the solr-operator and a zookeeper-operator are running.

Create an example Solr cloud, with the following configuration.

```bash
$ cat example/test_solrcloud.yaml

apiVersion: solr.bloomberg.com/v1beta1
kind: SolrCloud
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  replicas: 4
  solrImage:
    tag: 8.1.1
```

Apply it to your Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f example/test_solrcloud.yaml
$ kubectl get solrclouds

NAME      VERSION   DESIREDNODES   NODES   READYNODES   AGE
example   8.1.1     4              2       1            2m

$ kubectl get solrclouds

NAME      VERSION   DESIREDNODES   NODES   READYNODES   AGE
example   8.1.1     4              4       4            8m
```

### Scaling

Increase the number of Solr nodes in your cluster.

```bash
$ kubectl scale --replicas=5 solrcloud/example
```

### Deleting

Decrease the number of Solr nodes in your cluster.

```bash
$ kubectl delete solrcloud example
```

### Dependent Kubernetes Resources

What actually gets created when the Solr Cloud is spun up?

```bash
$ kubectl get all

## Zookeeper Reference

Solr Clouds require an Apache Zookeeper to connect to.

The Solr operator gives a few options.

**Note** - Both options below come with options to specify a `chroot`, or a ZNode path for solr to use as it's base "directory" in Zookeeper. Before the operator creates or updates a StatefulSet with a given `chroot`, it will first ensure that the given ZNode path exists and if it doesn't the operator will create all necessary ZNodes in the path. If no chroot is given, a default of `/` will be used, which doesn't require the existence check previously mentioned. If a chroot is provided without a prefix of `/`, the operator will add the prefix, as it is required by Zookeeper.

### ZK Connection Info

This is an external/internal connection string as well as an optional chRoot to an already running Zookeeeper ensemble.
If you provide an external connection string, you do not _have_ to provide an internal one as well.

### Provided Instance

If you do not require the Solr cloud to run cross-kube cluster, and do not want to manage your own Zookeeper ensemble,
the solr-operator can manage Zookeeper ensemble(s) for you.

#### Zookeeper

Using the [zookeeper-operator](https://github.com/pravega/zookeeper-operator), a new Zookeeper ensemble can be spun up for 
each solrCloud that has this option specified.

The startup parameter `zookeeper-operator` must be provided on startup of the solr-operator for this parameter to be available.

#### Zetcd

Using [etcd-operator](https://github.com/coreos/etcd-operator), a new Etcd ensemble can be spun up for each solrCloud that has this option specified.
A [Zetcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/zetcd) deployment is also created so that Solr can interact with Etcd as if it were a Zookeeper ensemble.

The startup parameter `etcd-operator` must be provided on startup of the solr-operator for this parameter to be available.

### Solr Collections

Solr-operator can manage the creation, deletion and modification of Solr collections. 

Collection creation requires a Solr Cloud to apply against. Presently, SolrCollection supports both implicit and compositeId router types, with some of the basic configuration options including `autoAddReplicas`. 

Create an example set of collections against on the "example" solr cloud

```bash
$ cat example/test_solrcollection.yaml

apiVersion: solr.bloomberg.com/v1beta1
kind: SolrCollection
metadata:
  name: example-collection-1
spec:
  solrCloud: example
  collection: example-collection
  routerName: compositeId
  autoAddReplicas: false
  numShards: 2
  replicationFactor: 1
  maxShardsPerNode: 1
  collectionConfigName: "_default"
---
apiVersion: solr.bloomberg.com/v1beta1
kind: SolrCollection
metadata:
  name: example-collection-2-compositeid-autoadd
spec:
  solrCloud: example
  collection: example-collection-2
  routerName: compositeId
  autoAddReplicas: true
  numShards: 2
  replicationFactor: 1
  maxShardsPerNode: 1
  collectionConfigName: "_default"
---
apiVersion: solr.bloomberg.com/v1beta1
kind: SolrCollection
metadata:
  name: example-collection-3-implicit
spec:
  solrCloud: example
  collection: example-collection-3-implicit
  routerName: implicit
  autoAddReplicas: true
  numShards: 2
  replicationFactor: 1
  maxShardsPerNode: 1
  shards: "fooshard1,fooshard2"
  collectionConfigName: "_default"
```

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f examples/test_solrcollections.yaml
```

#### Solr Collection Alias

The solr-operator supports the full lifecycle of standard aliases. Here is an example pointing an alias to 2 collections

```
apiVersion: solr.bloomberg.com/v1beta1
kind: SolrCollectionAlias
metadata:
  name: collection-alias-example
spec:
  solrCloud: example
  aliasType: standard
  collections:
    - example-collection-1
    - example-collection-2
```

Aliases can be useful when migrating from one collection to another without having to update application endpoint configurations.

Routed aliases are presently not supported

  
## Solr Backups

Solr backups require 3 things:
- A solr cloud running in kubernetes to backup
- The list of collections to backup
- A shared volume reference that can be written to from many clouds
    - This could be a NFS volume, a persistent volume claim (that has `ReadWriteMany` access), etc.
    - The same volume can be used for many solr clouds in the same namespace, as the data stored within the volume is namespaced.
- A way to persist the data. The currently supported persistence methods are:
    - A volume reference (this does not have to be `ReadWriteMany`)
    - An S3 endpoint.
    
Backups will be tarred before they are persisted.

There is no current way to restore these backups, but that is in the roadmap to implement.


## Solr Prometheus Exporter

Solr metrics can be collected from solr clouds/standalone solr both residing within the kubernetes cluster and outside.
To use the Prometheus exporter, the easiest thing to do is just provide a reference to a Solr instance. That can be any of the following:
- The name and namespace of the Solr Cloud CRD
- The Zookeeper connection information of the Solr Cloud
- The address of the standalone Solr instance

You can also provide a custom Prometheus Exporter config, Solr version, and exporter options as described in the
[Solr ref-guide](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/monitoring-solr-with-prometheus-and-grafana.html#command-line-parameters).

Note that a few of the official Solr docker images do not enable the Prometheus Exporter.
Versions `6.6` - `7.x` and `8.2` - `master` should have the exporter available. 
  
  
## Solr Images

### Official Solr Images

The solr-operator will work with any of the [official Solr images](https://hub.docker.com/_/solr) currently available.

### Build Your Own Private Solr Images

The solr-operator supports private Docker repo access for Solr images you may want to store in a private Docker repo. It is recommended to source your image from the official Solr images. 

Using a private image requires you have a K8s secret preconfigured with appropreiate access to the image. (type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson)

```
apiVersion: solr.bloomberg.com/v1beta1
kind: SolrCloud
metadata:
  name: example-private-repo-solr-image
spec:
  replicas: 3
  solrImage:
    repository: myprivate-repo.jfrog.io/solr
    tag: 8.2.0
    imagePullSecret: "k8s-docker-registry-secret"
```

## Solr Operator

### Solr Operator Input Args

* **-zookeeper-operator** Whether or not to use the Zookeeper Operator to create dependent Zookeeepers.
                          Required to use the `ProvidedZookeeper.Zookeeper` option within the Spec.
                          If _true_, then a Zookeeper Operator must be running for the cluster.
                          ( _true_ | _false_ , defaults to _false_)
* **-etcd-operator** Whether or not to use the Etcd Operator to create dependent Zetcd clusters.
                     Required to use the `ProvidedZookeeper.Zetcd` option within the Spec.
                     If _true_, then an Etcd Operator must be running for the cluster.
                     ( _true_ | _false_ , defaults to _false_)
* **-ingress-base-domain** If you desire to make solr externally addressable via ingresses, a base ingress domain is required.
                        Solr Clouds will be created with ingress rules at `*.(ingress-base-domain)`.
                        ( _optional_ , e.g. `ing.base.domain` )
## Development

### Before you create a PR

The CRD should be updated anytime you update the API.

```bash
$ make manifests
```

Beware that you must be running an updated version of `controller-gen`. To update to a compatible version, run:

```bash
$ go get sigs.k8s.io/controller-tools/cmd/controller-gen@v0.2.2
```

Make sure that you have updated the go.mod file:

```bash
$ make mod-tidy
```

### Docker

#### Docker Images

Two Docker images are published to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/bloomberg/solr-operator), both based off of the same base image.

- [Builder Image](build/Dockerfile.build) - Downloads gomod dependencies, builds operator executable (This is not published, only used to build the following images)
- [Slim Image](build/Dockerfile.slim) - Contains only the operator executable
- [Vendor Image](build/Dockerfile.slim) - Contains the operator executable as well as all dependencies (at `/solr-operator-vendor-sources`)

#### Building

Building and releasing a test operator image with a custom namespace.

```bash
$ NAMESPACE=your-namespace make docker-build docker-push
```

You can test the vendor docker container by running

```bash
$ NAMESPACE=your-namespace make docker-vendor-build docker-vendor-push
```

### Docker for Mac Local Development Setup

#### Install and configure on Docker for Mac

1. (Download and install latest stable version)[https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/]
2. Enable K8s under perferences
3. Ensure you have kubectl installed on your Mac (if using Brew: `brew install kubernetes-cli`
3. Run through [Getting Started](#getting-started)
3. Install nginx-ingress configuration

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/static/mandatory.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/static/provider/cloud-generic.yaml
```

4. Ensure your /etc/hosts file is setup to use the ingress for your SolrCloud. Here is what you need if you name your SolrCloud 'example' with 3 replicas

```
127.0.0.1	localhost default-example-solrcloud.ing.local.domain ing.local.domain default-example-solrcloud-0.ing.local.domain default-example-solrcloud-1.ing.local.domain default-example-solrcloud-2.ing.local.domain dinghy-ping.localhost
```

5. Navigate to your browser: http://default-example-solrcloud.ing.local.domain/solr/#/ to validate everything is working


## Version Compatibility & Upgrade Notes

#### v0.2.3
- If you do not use an ingress with the Solr Operator, the Solr Hostname and Port will change when upgrading to this version. This is to fix an outstanding bug. Because of the headless service port change, you will likely see an outage for inter-node communication until all pods have been restarted.

#### v0.2.2
- `SolrCloud.spec.solrPodPolicy` has been **DEPRECATED** in favor of the `SolrCloud.spec.customSolrKubeOptions.podOptions` option.  
This option is backwards compatible, but will be removed in a future version (`v0.3.0`).

- `SolrPrometheusExporter.spec.solrPodPolicy` has been **DEPRECATED** in favor of the `SolrPrometheusExporter.spec.customKubeOptions.podOptions` option.  
This option is backwards compatible, but will be removed in a future version (`v0.3.0`).

#### v0.2.1
- The zkConnectionString used for provided zookeepers changed from using the string provided in the `ZkCluster.Status`, which used an IP, to using the service name. This will cause a rolling restart of your solrs using the provided zookeeper option, but there will be no data loss.

#### v0.2.0
- Uses `gomod` instead of `dep`
- `SolrCloud.spec.zookeeperRef.provided.zookeeper.persistentVolumeClaimSpec` has been **DEPRECATED** in favor of the `SolrCloud.zookeeperRef.provided.zookeeper.persistence` option.  
This option is backwards compatible, but will be removed in a future version (`v0.3.0`).
- An upgrade to the ZKOperator version `0.2.4` is required.

#### v0.1.1
- `SolrCloud.Spec.persistentVolumeClaim` was renamed to `SolrCloud.Spec.dataPvcSpec`

### Compatibility with Kubernetes Versions

#### Fully Compatible - v1.13+

#### Feature Gates required for older versions

- *v1.10* - CustomResourceSubresources
