solr-operator
=============
A Helm chart for the Solr Operator.

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `test`:

```console
$ helm install test .
```

The command deploys the solr-operator on the Kubernetes cluster with the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

**NOTE**: Since by default the `useZkOperator` option is set to `True`, you must have already installed the [Zookeeper Operator](https://github.com/pravega/zookeeper-operator) in your kubernetes cluster. A helm chart is [also available](https://github.com/pravega/zookeeper-operator/blob/master/charts/zookeeper-operator/Chart.yaml) for it.

## Helm Version Differences

### Helm 2

If you are using Helm 2, CRDs are installed using the crd-install hook. Prior to installing, you'll need to uncomment the last two lines in [kustomization.yaml](../../config/crd/kustomization.yaml), and run `make manifests`

You will also need to update the install command to use the name flag, as shown below.

```console
$ helm install --name test .
```

### Helm 3

Helm 3 automatically runs CRDs in the /crds directory, no further action is needed.

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `solr-operator` deployment:

### Helm 3

```console
$ helm uninstall test
```

### Helm 2

```console
$ helm delete test
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
